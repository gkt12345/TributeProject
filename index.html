            <h1>Personal life</h1>
            <p>His ancestral village is Lwali, which is in Jaiti taluka of Almora district of the Uttarakhand state. The
                village has population of 20 to 30 families. His father Pan Singh Dhoni left the village in 1970 for
                employment. He eventually settled in Ranchi. Dhoni's uncle Dhanpat Singh Dhauni and his cousin Hayat
                Singh Dhauni still live in Lwali.

                He married Sakshi Singh Rawat on 4 July 2010.

                The wedding took place one day after the couple got engaged. According to the
                Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu, a close friend[dubious – discuss] of Dhoni, the wedding was planned for
                months and was not a spur of the moment decision. Dhoni and his wife have one
                daughter.

                Dhoni is a great enthusiast of the Indian Army. While spending a day with the parachute regiment in
                Ranchi, Dhoni said, "Since childhood I wanted to join the Army. Seeing the soldiers, I thought one day
                I'll be the same".
